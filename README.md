# Employee-Attrition-Analysis

Kindly refer to the report and R file attached for detailed analysis of the project.

## Project Overview

This predictive analytics project focuses on developing a machine learning model in R to predict employee attrition for ABC Company in the best possible manner.

Employee Attrition refers to the process of employees leaving an organisation voluntarily, either through resignation, retirement, or other reasons, resulting in a reduction in the organisation's workforce size. Attrition can have significant implications for organisational performance, including increased recruitment costs, loss of institutional knowledge, and decreased morale among remaining employees. Understanding the drivers of employee attrition and implementing strategies to mitigate its impact is essential for organisations to maintain a stable and productive workforce.

By employing various ML models, we aim to identify the best model to predict employee attrition.


## Problem Statement

ABC company is facing problems of high employee attrition. The company understands that employees are the most important part of an organisation, and successful employees meet deadlines, make sales, and build the brand through positive customer interactions. Hence, the company wants to understand which segments of employees are likely to resign. The company's Human Resources department has surveyed and collected data on several variables. Based on the available data, the primary objective is to create an ML model that can predict the attrition of employees in the best possible manner.

## Data and Tools

- For this project, R studio has been used.
- Data file provided is an Excel file by the name - "Employee Attrition.xlsx"

## Project and It's Analysis

- Kindly refer to the R file attached for code
- Please refer to the attached "Employee Attrition Report" for detailed project go through.
- A presentation is attached with the files, to explain the overall project.

## Result

- Based on the comparison of performance metrics, it is evident that Model 6, which utilises the Random Forest algorithm, outperforms the other models regarding accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and balanced accuracy. 
- With a nearly perfect accuracy of 99.63% and excellent sensitivity and specificity, Model 6 demonstrates superior predictive performance for attrition prediction in the context of ABC Company.
- The Random Forest algorithm's ability to handle complex relationships in the data and mitigate overfitting using an ensemble of decision trees makes it the best choice for accurately identifying employees at risk of leaving the company.
- Therefore, Model 6 is recommended as the most suitable model for predicting employee attrition and informing HR decision-making processes in ABC Company.
- Detailed output for Model 6 - Based on Random Forest is shown below -
